# About-Me

I am Sanju Xavier, a passionate data analyst working on personal projects and soon to be transitioned to work with organisations that want to make effective use of their data; from the first ideas around what you want to measure and how to capture data accurately, through data preparation, analysis and management, all the way to impactful presentation of insights. I can support each step of the process to enable your organization in making evidence-driven decisions or share insights with new audiences.
